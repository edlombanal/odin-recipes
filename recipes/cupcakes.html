            <li>se a traditional-style ice-cream scoop, or spoon, to divide the mixture between all the paper cases making sure to get an even amount of mixture in each.</li>
            <li>Place both muffin tins in the oven and bake for 15 minutes, then swap over the position of the tins over and bake for a further 3-7 minutes, until both trays of cupcakes are a light golden colour.</li>
