        <h2><strong>Ingredients for 12 servings:</strong></h2>
        <ul>
            <li>100g of granulated sugar.</li>
            <li>165g of brown sugar.</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon of salt.</li>
            <li>115g of unsalted, melted butter.</li>
            <li>1 egg.</li>
            <li>155g of all-purpose flour.</li>
            <li>0.5 teaspoon of baking soda.</li>
            <li>110g of chocolate chips or chunks.</li>
            <li>110g of dark chocolate chunks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><strong>Instructions:</strong></h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the sugars, salt, and butter until a paste forms with no lumps.</li>
            <li>Whisk in the egg and vanilla, beating until light ribbons fall off the whisk and remain for a short while before falling back into the mixture.</li>
            <li>Sift in the flour and baking soda, then fold the mixture with a spatula (Be careful not to overmix, which would cause the gluten in the flour to toughen resulting in cakier cookies).</li>
            <li>Fold in the chocolate chunks, then chill the dough for at least 30 minutes. For a more intense toffee-like flavor and deeper color, chill the dough overnight. The longer the dough rests, the more complex its flavor will be.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (180°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Scoop the dough with an ice-cream scoop onto a parchment paper-lined baking sheet, leaving at least 4 inches (10 cm) of space between cookies and 2 inches (5 cm) of space from the edges of the pan so that the cookies can spread evenly.</li>
            <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until the edges have started to barely brown.</li>
            <li>Cool completely before serving.</li>
        </ol>
